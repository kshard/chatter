## Inspiration

> A good prompt has 4 key elements: Role, Task, Requirements, Instructions.
["Are You AI Ready? Investigating AI Tools in Higher Education â€“ Student Guide"](https://ucddublin.pressbooks.pub/StudentResourcev1_od/chapter/the-structure-of-a-good-prompt/)

In the research community, there was an attempt for making [standardized taxonomy of prompts](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.946.pdf) for large language models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks. It encourages the community to adopt the TELeR taxonomy to achieve meaningful comparisons among LLMs, facilitating more accurate conclusions and helping the community achieve consensus on state-of-the-art LLM performance more efficiently.

The library addresses the LLMs comparisons by 
* Creating generic trait to "interact" with LLMs;
* Enabling prompt definition into [seven distinct levels](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.946.pdf);
* Supporting variety of LLMs.   

```go
type Chatter interface {
	Prompt(context.Context, *Prompt) (*Prompt, error)
}
```

## Getting started

The latest version of the library is available at `main` branch of this repository. All development, including new features and bug fixes, take place on the `main` branch using forking and pull requests as described in contribution guidelines. The stable version is available via Golang modules.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/kshard/chatter"
	"github.com/kshard/chatter/bedrock"
)

func main() {
	assistant, err := bedrock.New(
		bedrock.WithModel(bedrock.LLAMA3_0_8B_INSTRUCT),
		bedrock.WithQuotaTokensInReply(512),
	)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	var prompt chatter.Prompt
	prompt.WithTask("Extract keywords from the text: %s", /* ... */)

	reply, err := assistant.Prompt(context.Background(), &prompt)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("==> (%d)\n%s\n", assistant.ConsumedTokens(), reply)
}
```

## How To Contribute

It also defines a common data type for prompting, which is automatically adopted into the most suitable prompt style of the target model.

```go
prompt := chatter.NewPrompt(
  chatter.WithStratum("You are pirate, Captain Blood."),
  chatter.WithContext("\"Captain Blood: His Odyssey\" book by Rafael Sabatini constraints replies."),
)

prompt.Inquiry("What we are doing upon arrival on the island of Barbados?")
```

The prompt above settle the model behavior and context into [Captain Blood Novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Blood_(novel))

**gpt-3.5-turbo-0125**: Ah, me hearties! Upon reaching the shores of Barbados, we shall make haste to investigate the town of Bridgetown. Keep a keen eye out for opportunities to bolster our crew and provisions, for Barbados is a veritable treasure trove of resources ripe for the taking. And beware the cunning ways of the local authorities, for they may seek to thwart our plans at every turn. But fear not, for with cunning and daring, we shall carve a path to greatness on this island paradise. Onward, me hearties, for our odyssey has only just begun!

**llama2-13b-chat-v1**: Ahoy, matey! *adjusts eye patch* Ah, the fair isle of Barbados! *smirks wickedly* We be here for plunder, of course! The Spanish galleons be filled with gold and treasure, just waitin' for us to take 'em down. But first, we'll need to gather our wits and our strength, and prepare for battle. *pours self a mug of grog* Care to join me in a drink, matey? We'll need all the courage we can get for what's to come!

**titan-text-lite-v1**: We are looking for a ship to command.
